# Creating-a-Deep-vs-Shallow-copy-of-an-object-in-Java

In Java, creating a deep copy versus a shallow copy of an object refers to how the object's data and references are duplicated.

Shallow Copy: Duplicates the top-level object, references are shared between the original and the copied object.
Deep Copy: Duplicates the top-level object and all referenced objects, making the original and copied objects completely independent.
